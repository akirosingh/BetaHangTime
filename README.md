# BetaHangtime

BetaHangtime is a web application that allows users to analyze rock climbing videos by recording and analyze their keystrokes as a proxy for hand movements over time. By pressing and holding F (Left Hand) and J (Right hand), users can track their movements and obtain statistics on rock climbs they care about.

## Tips
- There is a learning curve to this. Try on a short video first.
- Predicting climbing movement can be tricky, having two climbing windows open with one a little ahead can help
- Reaction time is about 0.2 seconds so differences that are smaller might not be relevant
